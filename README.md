# subjective-interpolation-of-meaningful-sounds-on-earth
This website is created as a supplementary resource for my thesis project Unknown Universe. You can see the full list and all generated sounds including original, reconstruction and interpolation [here](https://jooohyunpark.github.io/subjective-interpolation-of-meaningful-sounds-on-earth/). Everything is implemented with Google's [NSynth Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/nsynth/nsynth.ipynb).
